Hello all.

This is my first python project.  I stumbled upon this posting on Reddit and 
thought it sounded like a fun program.  Here is the link to the post.

It looks like the program has been abandoned so I decided to adopt it. All 
credit though goes to James Atkinson.  

Here are some things I learned through this:
1) You'll need to download the python program called speeedtest-cli.
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/speedtest-cli/
This is the program that actually conducts the ping and download/upload tests.

2) This is also my first time interacting with APIs.  There is a Twitter
library for python and here is a git that explains how to dowload it and what 
do to install it.  It also explains how to get the security keys and tokens to 
make this work.

3) I initially tried to rekey this project instead of copy/paste. I thought this
would help me learn the code but it just created so many errors b/c I would
miskey something or fat finger my code.  I'm not sure I would do that again.

I'm looking forward to my next project and feel free to reach out to me with any
improvements or corrections you have.
